# MyFirstBlog
Here i'll program my first blog

Blog is too much, so i'll call as prototype of a blog, because, i dont know yet how i'll create an admin page to create posts.
<br>
The premise was to create without any framework, but i'll think about it a little bit more, because i'll need it to create the admin page and make the validation of user (i'm newbie in this thing yet).

****
**technologies i'll use 👇🏾:**

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* **Bootstrap (i'm thinking about 🤔)**
